# Final Project Mode (instructor-facing)

1. [Context](#context)
2. [Teaching Tips](#teaching-tips)

## Context

You've reached the end of new content for this course! Students are likely overwhelmed; it takes seeing the Flask Framework and using MongoDB multiple times before it starts to make sense. If students are frustrated or confused, there is time during project mode for targeted re-teaching. Here are some suggestions for how to help students manage their panic and ultimately triumph during this final project mode.

Also refer to the Flask Project Guide for additional details and expectations: https://github.com/upperlinecode/tech-exchange-2021/blob/main/u3-flask-mongo/flask-project-guide.md

## Teaching Tips

Use the launch of project mode as an opportunity to get students excited about bringing together everything they've learned so far. Remind students that they should start small, defining an MVP and building things that work every step of the way instead of producing a hairball of code that doesnâ€™t work but is too complicated to debug.

Once students have laid out their plan for their MVP, they'll know where they want additional guidance before coding. One option is to have small-group sessions where you re-teach content from Flask and MongoDB. Perhaps one group is implementing user logins but they were confused in the Advanced Mongo lesson. They may choose to attend a re-teach session while other groups are working on their projects. If another group is not sure how to use the CSS grid, they may want a special re-teach session on that, which not all students will attend.

It's important to celebrate bugs and normalize struggle. When students come together to share out what they've built thus far, ask them to talk about a particularly gnarly bug they faced and the skills they employed to push through it. As the person who sees what everyone is working on (because you're visiting each group as they code), you can also create strategic connections - for example suggesting that one group share a snippet of their code with another group who's working on a similar challenge. When students can work together and use online resources to solve problems, they learn the skills that will make them successful as software developers.

Remind students about the importance of workflow as they code together. They will need to deal with merge conflicts, and it will take time to figure out who has the latest version and how to make sure the main branch on GitHub reflects the code they want integrated. Coding is a process of alternately dividing up responsibilities and then coming together to merge the pieces. If the focus is on process over product, then the product is more likely to end up being something that all students are proud of.
