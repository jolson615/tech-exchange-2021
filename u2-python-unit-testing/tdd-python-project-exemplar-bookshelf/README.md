# Bookshelf
Bookshelf allows users to organize their favorite books in a digital bookshelf.  These models could be used to organize a database of users, each with their own book collections.

## Using Bookshelf CLI
To begin use the command line interface, fork and clone this repo and run ```python3 book_cli.py``` in your terminal.

To add books, respond to the provided prompts on the command line.  The command line does not allow persistance of user or book data, but demonstrates how these models could be used to organize a database.
