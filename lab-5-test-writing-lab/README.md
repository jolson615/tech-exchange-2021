# Funky Functions: Calculator Lab

## Objectives

* Student-facing language

**Core requirement:** Unless your teacher communicates otherwise, [replace this with what you imagine the core requirements of the lab to be, e.g. complete at last the first 6 items].

## Context

We're trying to program a python calculator by creating functions that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and perform other useful calculations. However, some of our functions are not working! Your job is to write unit tests for each function. Make sure to test both the accuracy of the functions and the proper raising of value and type errors.

## The Setup

Clone or import this lab to the coding environment of your choice.

Open calculator.py and test_calculator.py. You will need to write unit tests in test_calculator.py to test each of the calculator functions. Based on the results of your unit tests, edit the functions in calculator.py to give accurate answers and raise appropriate errors.

## The Lab

### Function 1: add
* Write unit tests in test_calculator.py to check the accuracy of the add function
* Write unit tests to check that a type error is raised when an input is not an integer or a float
* Edit the add function in calculator.py in order to pass all tests

### Function 2: subtract
* Write unit tests to check the accuracy of the subtract function
* Write unit tests to check that a type error is raised when an input is not an integer or a float
* Edit the subtract function in order to pass all tests

### Function 3: multiply
* Write unit tests to check the accuracy of the multiply function
* Write unit tests to check that a type error is raised when an input is not an integer or a float
* Edit the multiply function in order to pass all tests

### Function 4: divide
* Write unit tests to check the accuracy of the divide function
* Write unit tests to check that a type error is raised when an input is not an integer or a float
* Write unit tests to check that a value error is raised when dividing by zero
* Edit the divide function in order to pass all tests

### Function 5: tip
* The tip function should take in a bill amount and a tip percentage and return the total amount to be paid, but it isn't quite working properly. Write unit tests to check the accuracy of the tip function
* Write unit tests to check that a type error is raised when an input is not an integer or a float
* Edit the tip function in order to pass all tests

### Function 6: scrabble_value
* The scrabble_value function should take in a word as a string and return the value of that word in scrabble tiles (tile values are given in the letter_value dictionary in scrabble.py). Write unit tests to check the accuracy of the scrabble_value function
* Write unit tests to check that a type error is raised when an input is not a string
* Write unit tests to check that a value error is raised when the word length is impossible
* Edit the scrabble_value function in order to pass all tests
