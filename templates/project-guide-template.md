## Teaching Tips

For Teachers

## What We’re Building <a id="building"></a>

Student-facing language please. Please leave the a-link above.  

## Requirements

Each group's project must demonstrate each of the following:
* Student-facing language, as many bullets as needed, and always include "You must make something you're proud of!" at the end
* You must make something you're proud of!

## Launch

Explain how to launch the project, with an emphasis on how to guide ideation.

## Recommended Benchmarks

While it's not required that you collect any student work beyond the project itself, sometimes requiring students to submit one or more of the following before they are allowed to log out of class can be an excellent way of ensuring that students are on track, and that they have a focus for their work on any given day. 

It's ultimately your choice as the instructor whether to communicate any of these as deadlines for your students, but if you find that your students respond well to incremental deadlines and daily expectations, these are good starting points.
