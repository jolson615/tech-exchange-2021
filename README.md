# Pacing Recommendations

As you read over these lesson materials, please bear in mind that the following caveats:
* Each lesson is designed to fit comfortably within a 2-hour lesson block, but that doesn't mean you should aim to teach them for a full two hours. Most are actually achievable in 45-60 minutes Some lessons have stretch content included, but the default should be NOT teaching that stretch content. 
* This course is, apart from project mode, **overplanned**. It's always better to overplan than to underplan, as it's challenging to make up new material on the fly, but the danger of overplanning is that you feel compelled to rush through material in order to cover it all. This is absolutely the wrong move, as it's better to take your time with difficult material. To that end, there are a few lessons that are prime candidates to be cut:
    * HTML & GitHub project mode is currently a dedicated week of worktime. This may be important if students need more practice working together, if they need a lot of support and practice with Git, or if it's their first time working through HTML and it's clear they need more time. If none of these things are true, consider lowering the number of requirements on project 1 so that you can shorten this unit by a day or two. 
    * Python Object-Orientation, while a rich and robust topic, is not strictly necessary to make final projects. If students are struggling with unit testing, consider this lesson for the chopping block. 
* There are also a few pieces of the course that should be preserved if at all possible. 
    * While not everyone needs to explore advanced features of MongoDB, the idea of logging in and logging out is so essential to most user experiences that it's important at least some students get the chance to use that if possible. If a student is already panicked, this can be overwhelming, so that's a great day to split the class with a TA and have some students review Flask basics while others think more deeply about databases. 
    * The final project mode is truly where all the concepts of the class come together. Students need this time to solidify their understanding of the concepts covered throughout the course. It can be tempting to think "oh we can just shorten project mode to fit everything in," but since the point of everything leading up to projects is to empower students for an awesome project mode, it's like spending extra time cooking a gourmet dinner to then eat it in a rush - it's ultimately not worth it. 

All of these pacing guidelines can really be summed up in a few basic teaching principles:
1. **Teach Less.** Students learn more by doing than by listening, so when in doubt, narrow lessons to their essential pieces. Make sure they have what is absolutely necessary to start work, and make more time for independent practice.
3. **Slow Down.** In general, it's always better for students to get deeper practice with one essential concept than to get weak practice with several concepts. If some students need to move slowly while others keep moving at a brisk pace, try providing independent resources to the students who are moving quickly, and then provide more focused support for the beginners who need to move more slowly. You really want moving slowly and mastering concepts to be the default in your class.
2. **Speed Up.** Anytime something is mentioned here that you can concretely demonstrate that all your students know, feel free to abridge it significantly. One important caveat: just because your 5 most eager-to-participate students know something well doesn't mean that everyone does. It's important to make the call about when to speed up based on the students at tail end of the bell curve, and not based on your top perfomers.
