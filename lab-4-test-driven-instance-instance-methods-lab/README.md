# LAB TITLE

## Objectives

* Practice writing class definitions (including an __init__, instance variables, and instance methods)
* Modify and improve class definitions based on feedback from unit tests

**Core requirement:** Unless your teacher communicates otherwise, you must complete the pets.py file so that it passes the test_pets.py unit tests. 

## Context

You have just been hired by Pawsome Pets, a local animal shelter, to help all of their pets find forever homes! Currently, their file system is a mess, making it hard to know which pets are available, which have been adopted, and which will be a good fit for potential owners. The shelter knows how they want the information to be organized, but they need your help to do it! You will be writing code in the pets.py file in order to pass the pre-written unit tests in test_pets.py. If you complete the pets file, then you can work on organizing whole-shelter-level information in the shelter.py file!

## The Setup

Clone or import this lab to the coding environment of your choice.

Then, open up pets.py in your editor.

## The Lab


### Part 1: Pets
Open up pets.py in your editor. Run the unit tests by typing "python test_pets.py" into your command line. Follow the directions in the failure messages to improve your class definition in order to classify the shelter's pets.

## Part 2: Shelter (STRETCH)
Now that you have organized the information on individual pets, the shelter would like you to help organize some of the shelter-wide info, such as the total number of pets, operating budget, and donations. Open up shelter.py in your editor. Run the unit tests by typing "python test_shelter.py" into your command line. Follow the directions in the failure messages to improve your class definition.
