# Git Branch Scavenger Hunt

## Objectives
Core Objectives:
* SW learn to commit changes before changing branches
* SW learn to checkout local branches

**Core requirement:** Unless your teacher communicates otherwise, complete at least the first 3 lists.

## Context

You wake up to the sound of your alarm, but when you look out of the window, you see that everything is blanketed in a sheet of fluffy white snow! Everyone's excited for their favorite snow day activity, so everyone goes off to find the items they need. You've already found your favorite snow day song, so hit play and let's help everyone else find the items they're looking for. 

## The Setup

Open up the Terminal or Command Prompt. 
Clone this lab to the coding environment of your choice. 
Open up the repository in your editor. 

In the main branch of this lab, you will find the items you are looking for. Each room is a different branch on the repository. These are all of the rooms in the house:
* Bedroom
* Kitchen
* Living Room
* Dining Room
* Basement

When you find an object that matches the description of the item on your scavenger list, edit the file to write the description next to the object name in brackets [].

For example:
```html
Puppy [Something with four legs and a tail]
```
