# Student-facing Materials

## Objectives

* Get to know your group members and support one another in learning and trying new things
* Plan the layout and visual design of your website before launching into building it
* Divide up responsibilities & prioritize features of your project
* Practice HTML at the edge of your learning zone, wherever that may be
* Use GitHub for effective collaboration and version control
* Learn and implement new CSS properties and combinations of properties

## What We’re Building <a id="building"></a>

You and your team will build a website for a business that you intend to start together. You aren't required to ACTUALLY start the business when this course ends (though we certainly won't stop you), so it's up to you whether your business is a serious viable idea like an arepas restaurant, something a bit more whimsical like a [penny-farthing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing) rental company, or even something fantastic like a unicorn petting zoo.

The point here is to have fun, get to know your teammates, and practice working together. 

This is also your chance to make sure everyone feels like they've got a good handle on HTML and CSS, and that each team member has had a chance to practice making pull requests to GitHub. If you've practiced this before, plan to step into the mentoring role that senior engineers take. If this is your first time, be bold and ask your teammates, TAs, and teacher for help. 

## Requirements

Each group's project must demonstrate each of the following:
* At least three different `.html` pages, with links that allow a user to navigate from one to another. 
* Use of at least 8 different HTML elements inside the `body` of each page, including but certainly not limited to  `a`, `img`, `p`, and `div`
* At least one stylesheet, with at least 10 different rulesets in it. 
* At least three different branches, or evidence of at least one merge conflict which you have resolved. 
* You must make something you're proud of!

## Exemplar

Before launching into your projects, you may want to take a moment to review the exemplar project. Reviewing an exemplar can help you make sure that the expectations you're placing on yourself are in line with the expectations of this course, so that you don't end up accidentally turning significantly more or less than is expected for this unit project.

## Teaching Tips

This is students' first time working at length on anything together, so it is critically important to lower the stakes as much as possible. Emphasize that the point is not for students to flex their existing coding skills, but rather to meet the core requirements and make sure that everyone on their team feels comfortable with the HTML and CSS basics.

It's also going to be important to suss out which groups are dysfunctional as early as possible. The two strongest levers to do so are:
* Dropping by breakout rooms to examine the work that students are doing. 
* Checking in with student groups who do not meet benchmark deadlines. 

Avoid letting students allocate responsibilities such that one student in a group ends up with a completely nontechnical set of tasks. If, for example, a group tells you "Joseph is writing all the copy for the page in this Google Doc and then Alexandria's doing the HTML and I'm doing the CSS" that's a good sign that Joseph is experiencing some imposter syndrome and this group needs to be reminded to support him in learning HTML, not just cover for him so that he doesn't have to practice it. 


## Launch

Start with some ideation. Require each group of students to come up with and write down at least 10 different business ideas before you allow them to narrow down and choose one - even if they're sure their first idea is the best one. 

Then, mandate that students use either pen and paper, Google Drawings, Jamboard, or another tool to put together a rough visual outline of each of their three pages, including preliminary choices about what colors, fonts, and copy they plan to have on those pages. 

Finally, once you've approved their plan, coach them through creating a new repository, adding each other as collaborators, laying the foundations of their website, and committing up the file structure.  

Done well, this launch will take at least 45 minutes, even without students writing any code. It is almost always easier to help a student debug their HTML and CSS if they have a clear vision for what they're trying to create, so hold the line as best you can when it comes to not letting them start before finishing their ideation and mockups. 

## Recommended Benchmarks

While it's not required that you collect any student work beyond the project itself, sometimes requiring students to submit one or more of the following before they are allowed to log out of class can be an excellent way of ensuring that students are on track, and that they have a focus for their work on any given day. 

It's ultimately your choice as the instructor whether to communicate any of these as deadlines for your students, but if you find that your students respond well to incremental deadlines and daily expectations, these are good starting points. 

### Business Plan & Mockups

Have students submit the name of the business they're creating, a short description of what each of the three pages on their site will be for, and visual mockups of what each of the pages on their site will look like. Refer back to these mockups whenever students get stuck.

### Site Outline and/or Copy

Have students write an outline of what content will be on each page, and have them draft the copy in Google Docs - the spell checker alone will save them a lot of headache in the long run. 

### Division of Responsibilities

This is a good one to do every single day if students are struggling to allocate work equally. Have each student commit to their peers in writing what work they'll do before the next class. For example, if a group of students is working on a restaurant page like we did on the first day, student A will write the copy for the menu, student B will source the images for the menu, and student C will write the bios. 

Then have students use these DORs as the starting point for a stand-up the next class period. 

### Landing Page Presentation

Have students do a mini-presentation of the `index.html` page on their site. This serves dual purpose as an incremental deadline, and as a source of feedback on their project so far, before it's finished. This is less about giving and receiving explicit feedback from their peers, and more about sourcing inspiration from them. If one group sees that another group has used thoughtful color gradients in their backgrounds, they might be inspired to add some additional flair to their page. 

For maximum impact, carve out time explicitly for students to ask each other groups about how they did whatever they did well.
