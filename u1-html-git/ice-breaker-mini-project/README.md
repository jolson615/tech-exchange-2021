## Objectives

* Get to know your group members and support one another in learning and trying new things
* Practice HTML basics at the edge of your learning zone, wherever that may be
* Practice CSS basics at the edge of your learning zone, wherever that may be
* Create a multi-page website that represents your squad with a cohesive homepage to host the profiles.

## Teaching Tips

This is the first time students will be working together on a project, and even though it is a mini one, it's a great chance to check-in on their collaboration skills. This project will require an interview, some basic HTML/CSS work, and then a little bit of collaboration to build a homepage/landing page for all of the partner profiles.

If they have class work time, make sure to check-in and ensure that the group members are communicating to each other. The easiest way to do this is to drop into break out rooms and see what students are up to!

## What We’re Building <a id="building"></a>

You and your team will build a multipage website to represent - well, your team! You will each pick another team member to interview and build a page for and then you will all collaborate to create a homepage. Your website must have:

* A homepage with a cohesive design that links to each of your profiles.
* A profile for each team member, completed by a different team member.

How you theme these pages is up to you! The goal here is to practice the HTML and CSS we have learned so far, so don't feel pressured to make the _most beautiful_ website you've ever seen - just focus on trying to make it **fun** and representative of your group. Our big goal here is for you to get to know each other! We understand you are each coming in with your own level of prior knowledge or comfort with web design and we want to give each of you a chance to shine at whatever level you are at.

## Requirements

Each group's project must demonstrate each of the following:
* An index.html page that links to each partner profile
* A .html profile page for each team member, created by someone who is not that team member.
* As many different HTML tags as you can include - there is no specific numeric requirement, but try to practice as many of the skills we have learned as possible.
* CSS as you feel comfortable. There is no requirement on how you do this or the number of rules you set - for this project, anyway - but you should try to integrate enough to add some flair to your page.
* You must make something you're proud of!

## Launch

Split students into groups of ~3 (bump up to 4 or down to 2 if you absolutely must) and tell them that their goal is to get to know each other better. Each person must conduct an interview of another group member and must ask them at least 5, but as many questions as possible in 3 minutes, and take notes on their responses. Students can use whatever questions they'd like or you can provide some lists to pick from:

**The Basic Questions**
* What's your middle name?
* When is your birthday?
* What pronouns do you prefer?
* What's your sign?
* How many siblings do you have?
* Are you allergic to anything?

**The Slightly Less Basic Questions**
* What pets do you have?
* What are your favorite foods/snacks?
* What are your least favorite foods?
* What is the last media (book/podcast/show/movie) that you binged?
* What was your favorite subject in elementary school?
* What song can you listen to on repeat and it never gets old?

**The Bigger Questions**
* What is your goal in life?
* If you could go anywhere for one month but must leave right now, where would you go?
* You have to live your life as an animal, which do you choose?
* What super power would you like to be granted and why?
* What year do you remember most clearly from your K-12 education?

Feel free to alter/add to/subtract from these question lists based on your own interests and preferences as a teacher and what you know about your students so far. (If your students are foodies, you might change the questions to frame that - if they're music lovers, maybe adjust for that.) Plan for the intro to the interview and the interviews themselves to take about 20 minutes.

After students interview, bring them back and explain the project: the people they interviewed are actually their squad for this project, and they are going to make a website to demonstrate why they are squad goals complete with homepage and a .html page for each team member. The team member that they interviewed is the one they will be building the page for, and all squad members will be collaborating to make a cohesive homepage.

Since this is a mini project and their first time practicing with HTML/CSS, it is okay if this is not the most polished project ever, and even if each student takes the individual profile page in a different direction. Encourage students to make a wireframe of what they would like the profile they are making to look like and to collaborate together to make a vision for the homepage, as this will help with execution and debugging later. This plan can be made on paper, Jamboard, Google Drawings, or any other site that will allow them to plan and annotate their notes.

Once students have their plans made, they can begin coding. From interview to the end of the planning, it should take about 30 minutes before work time begins.

## Recommended Benchmarks

While it's not required that you collect any student work beyond the project itself, sometimes requiring students to submit one or more of the following before they are allowed to log out of class can be an excellent way of ensuring that students are on track, and that they have a focus for their work on any given day.

It's ultimately your choice as the instructor whether to communicate any of these as deadlines for your students, but if you find that your students respond well to incremental deadlines and daily expectations, these are good starting points.

## Page Plan

Have students submit the initial wireframe of their page.

## Squad Site Presentation

Have students present their sites to the group, showcasing their homepage and quick overviews of each profile presented by the team member who made it (this is also a great way to introduce the team member that was profiled to the rest of the group).
