## Context

Students should be familiar with the basics of python, and have been introduced to unit testing. In this lesson, we will introduce a more advanced python topic: Object Orientation. The suggested breakdown of time for this lesson is:  
 5 min: Intro  
 40 min: Code-Along  
 10 min: Break  
 40 min: Lab  
 15 min: Debrief the lab and close out lesson  

### Teaching Tip

When teaching about classes, it is tempting to delve into the weeds about _object_, _self_, _init_, and other key components. However, this can be confusing for beginners. Instead, focus on walking students through the examples and helping them correctly employ the necessary syntax.

### Lab

This lesson includes a lab in which students will practice writing class definitions and creating instances of a class. The lab contains stretch challenges, but it is not necessary for all students to reach those portions.

## Objectives

* SW understand what Object-oriented programming is and why it is used. 
* SW create instances of a class.
* SW write class definitions, including an __init__, instance variables, and at least one instance method. 
* [STRETCH] SW use dunders to create private variables and write custom getter and setter methods. 

## Setup

Both the instructor and the students should open and work in Google Cloud Shell for this lesson.

Prior to beginning the lesson, the instructor should open a new python file and copy the launch code, below. 

## Launch

Recommend a warm-up activity to set the stage for the lesson - what are we learning / making / doing and why?

## The Lesson

### Topic 

lesson text, followed by code snippet(s), and then ###Helpful Questions

```

#### Helpful Questions
* As many as needed

Repeat the topic-codeblock-questions loop as many times as needed to create the lesson.

## Extensions

Extensions are generally presented in order of difficulty, and should be offered to students with that caveat in mind. It's not critical that students do these activities specifically, but these are a good starting place.
